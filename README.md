# About SynBioHub

### How can I use SynBioHub?

SynBioHub is avalible through two projects:

* An [open source software project](https://github.com/SynBioHub/synbiohub) providing a web interface for the storing and publishing of synthetic biology designs.
* A public instance of the aforementioned software project at [synbiohub.org](http://synbiohub.org), allowing users to upload and share designs.


### What can SynBioHub be used for?

SynBioHub is the best way to publish a library of synthetic parts and designs. As a service it is used, to share designs with collaborators, and to store designs of biological systems locally. Data in SynBioHub can be accessed via the HTTP API, Java API, or Python API where it can then be integrated into CAD tools for building genetic designs. SynBioHub contains an interface for users to upload new biological data to the database, to visualize DNA parts, to perform queries to access desired parts, and to download SBOL, GenBank, FASTA, etc.
